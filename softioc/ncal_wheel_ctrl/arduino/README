This code is developed for a Teensy 3.5, mounted on a costum board.

The PCB has four female headers (1x24) to hold the Teensy 3.5 and a parallel headers on either side for additional acces to the pins.

The PCB can be powered from 12V to 35V, and has a regulator for the 5V for the Teensy. There is a A-Type USB connector on the PCB, which has no power connection to the Teensy, and only has the data lines forwarded to the Teensy (via connector J2). The 

The Teensy is pr


Teensy serial pins:

#define HWSERIAL Serial1                        // Used for Real-Time data comms, Rx pin 0, Tx pin 1

Teensy pin allocation:
