Notes for ACROMAG_BIO5_ISC.db - working controls to adjust gain



Input desired gain into temp using caput. temp is just a container

"base3" just rounds down to the nearrest multiple of 3 so that invalid gain inputs will be rounded to the lower valid gain input closest. 

"logic_CH0-3" continually take temp as an input and check to see if the gain in one in which the corresponding channel should be switched on. 
	Checking is manual and ugly to allow easy checking (not try to be too smart)
	The "CP MS" in the INPA is very important. Eliminates the need for the ai to have FLNK fields and continually scans the value of temp. Scan rate is uncertain
	In theory all of the calout records should be scanning simultaneously and so should be doing things at the same time

"A3:TESTING_CH0-3" turns one of the channels on or off. 
	Note that these output to a specific output address which is fixed and cannot be modified by passing different VAL to the bo
	Problems occur if 2 different records control the same channel since they can be telling the channel to do different things and cause floating/variation in the voltage
